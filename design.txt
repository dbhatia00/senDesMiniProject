Design Decisions

The first step of our design process was to create a barcode scanner using the BarCodeScanner module found at: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/bar-code-scanner/.
After importing the module, we updated App.js to include the barcode scanner. Barcode scanner features include: 
 
  1) If the user does not have their camera enabled, a message will inform the user that their camera is not accessible. 
  
  2) Upon scan of a barcode, the user will be redirected to nutritional facts for the product listed by the FDA
  
  3) The user will have the option to scan another barcode if needed 
  
The second step of our design process was to create a Gmail login page using the Google module found at: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/google/. 
After importing the module, we updated App.js to include the login page. Gmail login feautres include:

  1) Clicking on the link will open up a browser within the app
  
  2) The user will need to authenticate using a valid Gmail account
  
  3) The user will then be taken to the barcode if the Gmail is correct 
  
  
Next was the call to the FDC API. This was strapped to the barcode scanner module, eliminating extra steps for the user to access the targeted information.
For testing purposes, the entire data from the API was printed to the console. For sending to the database (and subsequently the REST API), we selected 
bits of information.
